# AQI to Cigarettes Calculator
This project is based on [work by Richard A. Muller and Elizabeth A. Muller](http://berkeleyearth.org/archive/air-pollution-and-cigarette-equivalence/) and inspired by living on the US west coast in the year 2020.

## Disclaimer
I am not a scientist or academic. This is a little project I did during a weekend when the AQI fluctuated between 400 and 650. PRs and issues welcome!

## Methods
The PM 2.5 to AQI converter uses an equation I found in the code of [this calculator](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-calculator/). The [breakpoints](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2014-05/documents/zell-aqi.pdf) are from the EPA. I assume that one cigarette [is equal to exposure to air pollution of 22 Î¼g/m3 for 24 hours](http://berkeleyearth.org/archive/air-pollution-and-cigarette-equivalence/).

## Project Status
'Beta version' is live [here](https://jasminedevv.github.io/AQI2cigarettes/).
